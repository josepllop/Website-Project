# Josep Llop Personal Website

Website Challenge:

Information conveyed:

This project will be a personal presentation site about myself (Josep Llop) to share my professional experience and personal hobbies as a supporting reference link for job applications. The site will have 3 sections one for my resume, one for my personal hobbies and one for contact me.

Directed to whom?

This website is intended to be shared as part of my application process for internships as a supporting site for employers to get to know me better.

Reason (why):

The main reason is because recruiting processes, especially in tech tend to be cold and not personal at all. This might help to put a face to my applications and to show not only a paper with chronological professional experience.
